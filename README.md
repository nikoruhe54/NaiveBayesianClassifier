# nb-tan-classfiers
## A program that implements both Naive Bayes and TAN (tree-augmented naive Bayes).##
* This python program implements the Naive Bayes and TAN classifiers intended for binary classification.
* Uses Prim Algorithm to construct the Maximal Spanning Tree in TAN.
* Laplace estimates is used to calculate all probabilities.
* The classifier can be tested on data sets used to predict lymphatic cancer included in the repo.
* The file format expected for the training and testing data sets is ARFF : http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/arff.html
* Usage : `bayes <train-set-file> <test-set-file> <n|t>`
<br> where n indicates Naive Bayes, t indicates TAN.
